       OpenID Continuous Access Evaluation Profile 1.0 - draft 03
                     openid-caep-specification-1_0

Abstract

   This document defines the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP)
   of the Shared Signals and Events Framework [SSE-FRAMEWORK].  It
   specifies a set of event types conforming to the SSE Framework.
   These event types are intended to be used between cooperating
   Transmitters and Receivers such that Transmitters may send continuous
   updates using which Receivers can attenuate access to shared human or
   robotic users, devices, sessions and applications.

1.  Introduction

   CAEP is the application of the Shared Signals and Events Profile of
   IETF Security Events 1.0 [SSE-FRAMEWORK] (SSE Profile) to ensure
   access security in a network of cooperating providers.  CAEP
   specifies a set of event-types that conform to the SSE Profile.  This
   document specifies the event-types required to achieve this goal.

1.1.  Notational Considerations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Optional Event Claims

   The following claims are optional unless otherwise specified in the
   event definition.

   event_timestamp  OPTIONAL, JSON number: the time at which the event
      described by this SET occurred.  Its value is a JSON number
      representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as
      measured in UTC until the date/time.

   initiating_entity  OPTIONAL, JSON string: describes the entity that
      invoked the event.

      This MUST be one of the following strings:

      *  admin: an administrative action triggered the event

      *  user: an end-user action triggered the event

      *  policy: a policy evaluation triggered the event

      *  system: a system or platform assertion triggered the event

   reason_admin  OPTIONAL, JSON object: a localizable administrative
      message intended for logging and auditing.  The object MUST
      contain one or more key/value pairs, with a BCP47 [RFC5646]
      language tag as the key and the locale-specific administrative
      message as the value.

       }
   }

                             multiple languages

   reason_user  OPTIONAL, JSON object: a localizable user-friendly
      message for display to an end-user.  The object MUST contain one
      or more key/value pairs, with a BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag as
      the key and the locale-specific end-user message as the value.

       }
   }

                                 languages

3.  Event Types

   The base URI for CAEP event types is:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/

3.1.  Session Revoked

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/session-revoked

   Session Revoked signals that the session identified by the subject
   has been revoked.  The explicit session identifier may be directly
   referenced in the subject or other properties of the session may be
   included to allow the receiver to identify applicable sessions.

   When a Complex Claim is used as the subject, the revocation event
   applies to any session derived from matching those combined claims.

                                CAEP-Spec                 September 2021


   The actual reason why the session was revoked might be specified with
   the nested reason_admin and/or reason_user claims described in
   Section 2.

3.1.1.  Event-Specific Claims

   There are no event-specific claims for this event type.

   When event_timestamp is included, its value MUST represent the time
   at which the session revocation occurred.

3.1.2.  Examples

   NOTE: The event type URI is wrapped, the backslash is the
   continuation character.

3.2.  Token Claims Change

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/token-claims-
   change

   Token Claims Change signals that a claim in a token, identified by
   the subject claim, has changed.

   with the nested reason_admin and/or reason_user claims made in
   Section 2.

3.2.1.  Event-Specific Claims

   claims  REQUIRED, JSON object: one or more claims with their new

3.3.  Credential Change

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/credential-change

   The Credential Change event signals that a credential was created,
   changed, revoked or deleted.  Credential Change scenarios include:

   *  password/PIN change/reset

   *  certificate enrollment, renewal, revocation and deletion

   *  second factor / passwordless credential enrollment or deletion
      (U2F, FIDO2, OTP, app-based)

   The actual reason why the credential change occurred might be
   specified with the nested reason_admin and/or reason_user claims made
   in Section 2.

3.3.1.  Event-Specific Claims

   credential_type  REQUIRED, JSON string: This MUST be one of the
      following strings, or any other credential type supported mutually
      by the Transmitter and the Receiver.

3.4.  Assurance Level Change

   Event Type URI:

   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/caep/event-type/assurance-level-
   change

   The Assurance Level Change event signals that there has been a change
   in authentication method since the initial user login.  This change
   can be from a weak authentication method to a strong authentication
   method, or vice versa.

   In the first scenario, Assurance Level Change will an increase, while
   in the second scenario it will be a decrease.  For example, a user
   can start a session with Service Provider A using single factor

                                CAEP-Spec                 September 2021


   authentication (such as a password).  The user can then open another
   session with Service Provider B using two-factor authentication (such
   as OTP).  In this scenario an increase Assurance Level Change event
   will signal to Service Provider A that user has authenticated with a
   stronger authentication method.

   The actual reason why the assurance level changed might be specified
   with the nested reason_admin and/or reason_user claims made in
   Section 2.

3.4.1.  Event-Specific Claims

   namespace:  REQUIRED, JSON string: the namespace of the values in the
      current_level and previous_level claims.  This string MAY be one

   current_level  REQUIRED, JSON string: The current assurance level, as
      defined in the specified namespace

   previous_level  OPTIONAL, JSON string: the previous assurance level,
      as defined in the specified namespace If the Transmitter omits

      level is unknown to the Transmitter

   change_direction  OPTIONAL, JSON string: the assurance level

      increased or decreased If the Transmitter has specified the
      previous_level, then the Transmitter SHOULD provide a value for
      this claim.  If present, this MUST be one of the following
      strings:

      *  increase

      *  decrease

   When event_timestamp is included, its value MUST represent the time
   at which the assurance level changed.
