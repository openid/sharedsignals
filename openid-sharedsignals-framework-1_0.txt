      OpenID Shared Signals Framework Specification 1.0 - draft 02
                   openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0

Abstract

   This Shared Signals Framework (SSF) enables sharing of signals and
   events between cooperating peers.  It enables multiple applications
   such as Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) and the
   Continuous Access Evaluation Profile ([CAEP])

   This specification defines:

   *  A profile for Security Events Tokens [RFC8417]

   *  Subject Principals

   *  Subject Claims in SSF Events

   *  Event Types

   *  Event Properties

   *  Configuration information and discovery method for Transmitters

   *  A Management API for Event Streams

   This spec also directly profiles several IETF Security Events drafts:

   *  Security Event Token (SET) [RFC8417]

   *  Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens [SUBIDS]

   *  Push-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP [DELIVERYPUSH]

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Subject Principals

   This Shared Signals Framework specification defines a Subject
   Principal to be the entities about which an event can be sent by
   Transmitters and received by Receivers using the Shared Signals
   Framework.

   Subject Principals are the managed entities in a SSF Transmitter or
   Receiver.  These include human or robotic principals, devices,
   customer tenants in a multi-tenanted service, organizational units
   within a tenant, groups of subject principals, or other entities that
   are managed by Transmitters and Receivers.  There may be other actors
   or resources that can be treated as Subject Principals, and event-
   type definitions SHOULD specify the range of principals addressed by
   the event.

   Subject Principals are identified by Subject Members defined below.

3.  Subject Members in SSF Events

   A member of type Subject in an SSF event MAY have any claim name.
   Each Subject Member MUST refer to exactly one Subject Principal.

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


   A Subject may be a "simple subject" or a "complex subject".

3.1.  Simple Subject Members

   A Simple Subject Member has a claim name and a value that is a
   "Subject Identifier" as defined in the Subject Identifiers for
   Security Event Tokens [SUBIDS].  Below is a non-normative example of
   a Simple Subject Member in a SSF event.

   "transferer": {
     "format": "email",
     "email": "foo@example.com"
   }

                     Figure 1: Example: Simple Subject

3.2.  Complex Subject Members

   A Complex Subject Member has a name and a value that is a JSON
   [RFC7159] object that has one or more Simple Subject Members.  The
   name of each Simple Subject Member in this value MAY be one of the
   following:

   user

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a user.

   device

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a device.

   session

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a session.

   application

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies an application.

   tenant

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a tenant.

   org_unit

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies an organizational
      unit.

   group

      OPTIONAL.  A Subject Identifier that identifies a group.

   Additional Subject Member names MAY be used in Complex Subjects.
   Each member name MAY appear at most once in the Complex Subject
   value.

   Below is a non-normative example of a Complex Subject claim in a SSF
   event.

   "transferee": {
     "user" : {
       "format": "email",
       "email": "bar@example.com"
     },
     "tenant" : {
       "format": "iss_sub",
       "iss" : "http://example.com/idp1",
       "sub" : "1234"
     }
   }

                     Figure 2: Example: Complex Subject

3.2.1.  Complex Subject Interpretation

   All members within a Complex Subject MUST represent attributes of the
   same Subject Principal.  As a whole, the Complex Subject MUST refer
   to exactly one Subject Principal.

3.3.  Subject Identifiers in SSF Events

   A Subject Identifier in a SSF event MUST have an identifier format
   that is any one of:

   *  Defined in the IANA Registry defined in Subject Identifiers for
      Security Event Tokens [SUBIDS]

   *  An identifier format defined in the Additional Subject Identifier
      Formats (Section 3.4) section below, OR

   *  A proprietary subject identifier format that is agreed to between
      parties.  Members within a subject identifier that has a
      proprietary subject identifier format are agreed to between the
      parties and such agreement is outside the scope of this
      specification.

3.4.  Additional Subject Identifier Formats

   The following new subject identifier formats are defined:

3.4.1.  JWT ID Subject Identifier Format

   The "JWT ID" Subject Identifier Format specifies a JSON Web Token
   (JWT) identifier, defined in [RFC7519].  Subject Identifiers of this
   type MUST contain the following members:

   iss

      REQUIRED.  The "iss" (issuer) claim of the JWT being identified,
      defined in [RFC7519]

   jti

      REQUIRED.  The "jti" (JWT token ID) claim of the JWT being
      identified, defined in [RFC7519]

   The "JWT ID" Subject Identifier Format is identified by the name
   "jwt-id".

   Below is a non-normative example of Subject Identifier for the "jwt-
   id" Subject Identifier Format.

   {
       "format": "jwt-id",
       "iss": "https://idp.example.com/123456789/",
       "jti": "B70BA622-9515-4353-A866-823539EECBC8"
   }

               Figure 3: Example: 'jwt-id' Subject Identifier

3.4.2.  SAML Assertion ID Subject Identifier Format

   The "SAML Assertion ID" Subject Identifier Format specifies a SAML
   2.0 [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] assertion identifier.  Subject
   Identifiers of this format MUST contain the following members:

   issuer

      REQUIRED.  The "Issuer" value of the SAML assertion being
      identified, defined in [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os]

   assertion_id

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


      REQUIRED.  The "ID" value of the SAML assertion being identified,
      defined in [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os]

   The "SAML Assertion ID" Subject Identifier Format is identified by
   the name "saml_assertion_id".

   Below is a non-normative example Subject Identifier for the
   "saml_assertion_id" Subject Identifier Format.

   {
       "format": "saml_assertion_id",
       "issuer": "https://idp.example.com/123456789/",
       "assertion_id": "_8e8dc5f69a98cc4c1ff3427e5ce34606fd672f91e6"
   }

         Figure 4: Example: 'saml_assertion_id' Subject Identifier

3.5.  Receiver Subject Processing

   A SSF Receiver MUST make a best effort to process all members from a
   Subject in an SSF event.  The Transmitter Configuration Metadata
   (Section 6.1) defined below MAY define certain members within a
   Complex Subject to be Critical.  A SSF Receiver MUST discard any
   event that contains a Subject with a Critical member that it is
   unable to process.

4.  Event Properties

   Additional members about an event may be included in the "events"
   claim.  Some of these members are required and specified as such in
   the respective event types specs.  If a Transmitter determines that
   it needs to include additional members that are not specified in the
   event types spec, then the name of such members MUST be a URI.  The
   discoverability of all additional members is specified in the
   Discovery Section 6 section.

5.  Example SETs that conform to the Shared Signals Framework

   The following are hypothetical examples of SETs that conform to the
   Shared Signals Framework.

6.1.  Transmitter Configuration Metadata

   Transmitters have metadata describing their configuration:

   issuer

      REQUIRED.  URL using the https scheme with no query or fragment
      component that the Transmitter asserts as its Issuer Identifier.
      This MUST be identical to the iss claim value in Security Event
      Tokens issued from this Transmitter.

   jwks_uri

      REQUIRED.  URL of the Transmitter's JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517]
      document.  This contains the signing key(s) the Receiver uses to
      validate signatures from the Transmitter.

   delivery_methods_supported

      RECOMMENDED.  List of supported delivery method URIs.

   configuration_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Configuration Endpoint.

   status_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Status Endpoint.

   add_subject_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Add Subject Endpoint.

   remove_subject_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Remove Subject Endpoint.

   verification_endpoint

      OPTIONAL.  The URL of the Verification Endpoint.

   critical_subject_members

      OPTIONAL.  List of member names in a Complex Subject which, if
      present in a Subject Member in an event, MUST be interpreted by a
      Receiver.

   TODO: consider adding a IANA Registry for metadata, similar to
   Section 7.1.1 of [OAUTH-DISCOVERY].  This would allow other specs to
   add to the metadata.

6.2.  Obtaining Transmitter Configuration Information

   Using the Issuer as documented by the Transmitter, the Transmitter
   Configuration Information can be retrieved.

   Transmitters supporting Discovery MUST make a JSON document available
   at the path formed by inserting the string "/.well-known/ssf-
   configuration" into the Issuer between the host component and the
   path component, if any.  The syntax and semantics of ".well-known"
   are defined in [RFC5785].  "ssf-configuration" MUST point to a JSON
   document compliant with this specification and MUST be returned using
   the "application/json" content type.

6.2.1.  Transmitter Configuration Request

   A Transmitter Configuration Document MUST be queried using an HTTP
   "GET" request at the previously specified path.

   The Receiver would make the following request to the Issuer
   "https://tr.example.com" to obtain its Configuration information,
   since the Issuer contains no path component:

   GET /.well-known/ssf-configuration HTTP/1.1
   Host: tr.example.com

    Figure 9: Example: Transmitter Configuration Request (without path)

   If the Issuer value contains a path component, any terminating "/"
   MUST be removed before inserting "/.well-known/ssf-configuration"
   between the host component and the path component.  The Receiver
   would make the following request to the Issuer
   "https://tr.example.com/issuer1" to obtain its Configuration
   information, since the Issuer contains a path component:

   GET /.well-known/ssf-configuration/issuer1 HTTP/1.1
   Host: tr.example.com

     Figure 10: Example: Transmitter Configuration Request (with path)

   Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host.
   This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations.  This
   use of ".well-known" is for supporting multiple issuers per host;
   unlike its use in [RFC5785], it does not provide general information
   about the host.

6.2.2.  Backward Compatibility for RISC Transmitters

   Existing RISC Transmitters MAY continue to use the path component
   "/risc-configuration" instead of the path component "/ssf-
   configuration" in the path for the Transmitter Configuration
   Metadata.  New services supporting the Shared Signals Framework
   SHOULD NOT use this location for publishing the Transmitter
   Configuration Metadata.  For example, the Transmitter Configuration
   Metadata for the Transmitter "https://risc-tr.example.com" MAY be
   obtained by making the following request:

   GET /.well-known/risc-configuration HTTP/1.1
   Host: risc-tr.example.com

       Figure 11: Example: Transmitter Configuration Request for RISC
                                Transmitters

6.2.3.  Transmitter Configuration Response

   The response is a set of Claims about the Transmitter's
   configuration, including all necessary endpoints and public key
   location information.  A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP
   status code and return a JSON object using the "application/json"
   content type that contains a set of Claims as its members that are a
   subset of the Metadata values defined in Section 6.1.  Other Claims
   MAY also be returned.

   Claims that return multiple values are represented as JSON arrays.
   Claims with zero elements MUST be omitted from the response.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

6.2.4.  Transmitter Configuration Validation

   If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification
   fail, any operations requiring the information that failed to
   correctly validate MUST be aborted and the information that failed to
   validate MUST NOT be used.

   The "issuer" value returned MUST be identical to the Issuer URL that
   was directly used to retrieve the configuration information.  This
   MUST also be identical to the "iss" Claim value in Security Event
   Tokens issued from this Transmitter.

7.  Management API for SET Event Streams

   An Event Stream is an abstraction for how events are communicated
   from a Transmitter to a Receiver.  The Event Stream's configuration,
   which is jointly managed by the Transmitter and Receiver, holds
   information about what types of events will be sent from the
   Transmitter, as well as the mechanism by which the Receiver can
   expect to receive the events.  The Event Stream also keeps track of
   what Subjects are of interest to the Receiver, and only events with
   those Subjects are transmitted on the stream.

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


   This section defines an HTTP API to be implemented by Event
   Transmitters which can be used by Event Receivers to create and
   delete one or more Event Streams.  The API can also be used to query
   and update the Event Stream's configuration and status, add and
   remove Subjects, and trigger verification for those streams.

                   Figure 13: Event Stream Management API

   It is OPTIONAL for Transmitters to implement a Management API, but it
   is RECOMMENDED that they implement it, especially the endpoints for
   querying the Stream Status and for triggering Verification.

7.1.  Event Stream Management

   Event Receivers manage how they receive events, and the subjects
   about which they want to receive events over an Event Stream by
   making HTTP requests to endpoints in the Event Stream Management API.

   A Transmitter and Receiver MAY use the same Event Stream for updates
   about multiple Subject Principals.  The status of the Event Stream
   MAY be queried and managed independently for each Subject Principal
   by Transmitters and Receivers.

   The Event Stream Management API is implemented by the Event
   Transmitter and consists of the following endpoints:

   Configuration Endpoint

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


      An endpoint used to create and delete Event Streams, as well as
      read and update an Event Stream's current configuration.

   Status Endpoint

      An endpoint used to read and update an Event Stream's current
      status.

   Add Subject Endpoint

      An endpoint used to add subjects to an Event Stream.

   Remove Subject Endpoint

      An endpoint used to remove subjects from an Event Stream.

   Verification Endpoint

      An endpoint used to request the Event Transmitter transmit a
      Verification Event over an Event Stream.

   An Event Transmitter MAY use the same URLs as endpoints for multiple
   Event Receivers, provided that the Event Transmitter has some
   mechanism through which they can identify the applicable set of Event
   Streams for any given request, e.g. from authentication credentials.
   The definition of such mechanisms is outside the scope of this
   specification.

7.1.1.  Stream Configuration

   An Event Stream's configuration is a collection of data, provided by
   both the Transmitter and the Receiver, that describes the information
   being sent over the Event Stream.  It is represented as a JSON
   [RFC7159] object with the following properties:

   stream_id

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, A string that uniquely identifies the
      stream.  Stream IDs MUST be unique per Reciever.  This value is
      generated by the Transmitter when the stream is created.

   iss

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, A URL using the https scheme with no query
      or fragment component that the Transmitter asserts as its Issuer
      Identifier.  This MUST be identical to the "iss" Claim value in
      Security Event Tokens issued from this Transmitter.

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


   aud

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, A string or an array of strings containing
      an audience claim as defined in JSON Web Token (JWT)[RFC7519] that
      identifies the Event Receiver(s) for the Event Stream.  This
      property cannot be updated.  If multiple Receivers are specified
      then the Transmitter SHOULD know that these Receivers are the same
      entity.

   events_supported

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, An array of URIs identifying the set of
      events supported by the Transmitter for this Receiver.  If
      omitted, Event Transmitters SHOULD make this set available to the
      Event Receiver via some other means (e.g. publishing it in online
      documentation).

   events_requested

      *Receiver-Supplied*, An array of URIs identifying the set of
      events that the Receiver requested.  A Receiver SHOULD request
      only the events that it understands and it can act on.  This is
      configurable by the Receiver.

   events_delivered

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, An array of URIs which is the intersection
      of "events_supported" and "events_requested".  These events MAY be
      delivered over the Event Stream.

   delivery

      *Receiver-Supplied*, A JSON object containing a set of name/value
      pairs specifying configuration parameters for the SET delivery
      method.  The actual delivery method is identified by the special
      key "method" with the value being a URI as defined in
      Section 11.2.1.

   min_verification_interval

      *Transmitter-Supplied*, An integer indicating the minimum amount
      of time in seconds that must pass in between verification
      requests.  If an Event Receiver submits verification requests more
      frequently than this, the Event Transmitter MAY respond with a 429
      status code.  An Event Transmitter SHOULD NOT respond with a 429
      status code if an Event Receiver is not exceeding this frequency.

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


      *Receiver-Supplied*, The Subject Identifier Format that the
      Receiver wants for the events.  If not set then the Transmitter
      might decide to use a type that discloses more information than
      necessary.

   TODO: consider adding a IANA Registry for stream configuration
   metadata, similar to Section 7.1.1 of [OAUTH-DISCOVERY].  This would
   allow other specs to add to the stream configuration.

7.1.1.1.  Creating a Stream

   In order to communicate events from a Transmitter to a Receiver, a
   Receiver MUST first create an Event Stream.  An Event Receiver
   creates a stream by making an HTTP POST request to the Configuration
   Endpoint.  On receiving a valid request the Event Transmitter
   responds with a "201 Created" response containing a JSON [RFC7159]
   representation of the stream's configuration in the body.

   The HTTP POST request MAY contain the Receiver-Supplied values of the
   Stream Configuration (Section 7.1.1) object:

   events_requested

      *Receiver-Supplied*, An array of URIs identifying the set of
      events that the Receiver requested.  A Receiver SHOULD request
      only the events that it understands and it can act on.  This is
      configurable by the Receiver.

   delivery

      *Receiver-Supplied*, A JSON object containing a set of name/value
      pairs specifying configuration parameters for the SET delivery
      method.  The actual delivery method is identified by the special
      key "method" with the value being a URI as defined in
      Section 11.2.1.

   format

      *Receiver-Supplied*, The Subject Identifier Format that the
      Receiver wants for the events.  If not set then the Transmitter
      might decide to use a type that discloses more information than
      necessary.

   The following is a non-normative example request to create an Event
   Stream:

7.1.1.2.  Reading a Stream's Configuration

   An Event Receiver gets the current configuration of a stream by
   making an HTTP GET request to the Configuration Endpoint.  On
   receiving a valid request the Event Transmitter responds with a "200
   OK" response containing a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the
   stream's configuration in the body.

   The GET request MAY include the "stream_id" as a parameter in order
   to identify the correct Event Stream.  If the "stream_id" argument is
   missing, then the Transmitter MUST return a list of the stream
   configurations available to this Receiver.  In the event that there
   are no Event Streams created, the Transmitter MUST return an empty
   list.

   The following is a non-normative example request to read an Event
   Stream's configuration:

7.1.1.3.  Updating a Stream's Configuration

   An Event Receiver updates the current configuration of a stream by
   making an HTTP PATCH request to the Configuration Endpoint.  The
   PATCH body contains a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the stream
   configuration properties to change.  On receiving a valid request the
   Event Transmitter responds with a "200 OK" response containing a JSON
   [RFC7159] representation of the entire updated stream configuration
   in the body.

   The stream_id property MUST be present in the request.  Other
   properties MAY be present in the request.  Any Receiver-Supplied
   property present in the request MUST be updated by the Transmitter.
   Any properties missing in the request MUST NOT be changed by the
   Transmitter.

   Transmitter-Supplied properties beside the stream_id MAY be present,
   but they MUST match the expected value.  Missing Transmitter-Supplied
   properties will be ignored by the Transmitter.

7.1.1.4.  Replacing a Stream's Configuration

   An Event Receiver replaces the current configuration of a stream by
   making an HTTP PUT request to the Configuration Endpoint.  The PUT
   body contains a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the new
   configuration.  On receiving a valid request the Event Transmitter
   responds with a "200 OK" response containing a JSON [RFC7159]
   representation of the updated stream configuration in the body.

   The stream_id and the full set of Receiver-Supplied properties MUST
   be present in the PUT body, not only the ones that are specifically
   intended to be changed.  Missing Receiver-Supplied properties MUST be
   interpreted as requested to be deleted.  Event Receivers MAY read the
   configuration first, modify the JSON [RFC7159] representation, then
   make a replacement request.

   Transmitter-Supplied properties besides the stream_id MAY be present,
   but they MUST match the expected value.  Missing Transmitter-Supplied
   properties will be ignored by the Transmitter.

   The following is a non-normative example request to replace an Event
   Stream's configuration:

7.1.1.5.  Deleting a Stream

   An Event Receiver deletes a stream by making an HTTP DELETE request
   to the Configuration Endpoint.  On receiving a request the Event
   Transmitter responds with an empty "204 OK" response if the
   configuration was successfully removed.

   The DELETE request MUST include the "stream_id" as a parameter in
   order to identify the correct Event Stream.

   The following is a non-normative example request to delete an Event
   Stream:

7.1.2.  Stream Status

   Within an Event Stream, events related to different Subject
   Principals MAY be managed independently.  A Receiver MAY request
   Subject Principals to be added to or removed from a stream by
   Updating the Stream Status (Section 7.1.2.2) and specifying the
   Subject in the request.

   A Transmitter MAY decide to enable, pause or disable updates about a
   Subject independently of an update request from a Receiver.  If a
   Transmitter decides to start or stop events for a Subject then the
   Transmitter MUST do the following according to the status of the
   stream.

   If the stream is:

   Enabled

      the Transmitter MUST send a stream updated (Section 7.1.5) event
      respectively to the Receiver within the Event Stream.

   Paused

      the Transmitter SHOULD send a stream updated (Section 7.1.5) after
      the Event Stream is re-started.  A Receiver MUST assume that
      events may have been lost during the time when the event stream
      was paused.

   Disabled

      the Transmitter MAY send a stream updated (Section 7.1.5) after
      the Event Stream is re-enabled.

7.1.2.1.  Reading a Stream's Status

   An Event Receiver checks the current status of an event stream by
   making an HTTP GET request to the stream's Status Endpoint.

   The Stream Status method takes the following parameters:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  The stream whose status is being queried.

   subject

      OPTIONAL.  The subject for which the stream status is requested.

   On receiving a valid request the Event Transmitter responds with a
   200 OK response containing a JSON [RFC7159] object with an attribute
   "status", whose string value MUST have one of the following values:

   enabled

      The Transmitter MUST transmit events over the stream, according to
      the stream's configured delivery method.

   paused

      The Transmitter MUST NOT transmit events over the stream.  The
      transmitter will hold any events it would have transmitted while
      paused, and SHOULD transmit them when the stream's status becomes
      "enabled".  If a Transmitter holds successive events that affect
      the same Subject Principal, then the Transmitter MUST make sure
      that those events are transmitted in the order of time that they
      were generated OR the Transmitter MUST send only the last events
      that do not require the previous events affecting the same Subject
      Principal to be processed by the Receiver, because the previous
      events are either cancelled by the later events or the previous
      events are outdated.

   disabled

      The Transmitter MUST NOT transmit events over the stream, and will
      not hold any events for later transmission.

   The following is a non-normative example request to check an event
   stream's status:

   Examples:

   1.  If a Receiver makes a request with an invalid OAuth token, then
       the Transmitter MUST respond with a 401 error status.

   2.  If the Receiver presents a valid OAuth token, but the Transmitter
       policy does not permit the Receiver from obtaining the status,
       then the Transmitter MAY respond with a 403 error status.

   3.  If the Receiver requests the status for a stream that does not
       exist then the Transmitter MUST respond with a 404 error status.

   4.  If the Receiver requests the status for a specific Subject, but
       the Transmitter policy does not permit the Receiver to read the
       status of that Subject, then the Transmitter MAY respond with a
       404 error status in order to not reveal the policy decision.

   5.  If the specified Subject is invalid then the Transmitter MUST
       respond with a 404 error status.

7.1.2.2.  Updating a Stream's Status

   An Event Receiver updates the current status of a stream by making an
   HTTP POST request to the Status Endpoint.  The POST body contains a
   JSON [RFC7159] object with the following fields:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  The stream whose status is being updated.

   status

   subject

      OPTIONAL.  The Subject to which the new status applies.

   reason

      OPTIONAL.  A short text description that explains the reason for
      the change.

   On receiving a valid request the Event Transmitter responds with a
   "200 OK" response containing a JSON [RFC7159] representation of the
   updated stream status in the body.

                    Table 7: Update Stream Status Errors

   Example:

   1.  If a Receiver makes a request to update a stream to enable it for
       a specific Subject, and the Transmitter is unable to decide
       whether or not to complete the request, then the Transmitter MUST
       respond with a 202 status code.

7.1.3.  Subjects

   An Event Receiver can indicate to an Event Transmitter whether or not
   the receiver wants to receive events about a particular subject by
   "adding" or "removing" that subject to the Event Stream,
   respectively.

7.1.3.1.  Adding a Subject to a Stream

   To add a subject to an Event Stream, the Event Receiver makes an HTTP
   POST request to the Add Subject Endpoint, containing in the body a
   JSON object the following claims:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  The stream to which the subject is being added.

   subject

      REQUIRED.  A Subject claim identifying the subject to be added.

   verified

      OPTIONAL.  A boolean value; when true, it indicates that the Event
      Receiver has verified the Subject claim.  When false, it indicates
      that the Event Receiver has not verified the Subject claim.  If
      omitted, Event Transmitters SHOULD assume that the subject has
      been verified.

   On a successful response, the Event Transmitter responds with an
   empty "200 OK" response.  The Event Transmitter MAY choose to
   silently ignore the request, for example if the subject has
   previously indicated to the Transmitter that they do not want events
   to be transmitted to the Event Receiver.  In this case, the
   transmitter MAY return an empty "200 OK" response or an appropriate
   error code.  See Security Considerations (Section 9).

   The following is a non-normative example request to add a subject to
   a stream, where the subject is identified by an Email Subject
   Identifier.

7.1.3.2.  Removing a Subject

   To remove a subject from an Event Stream, the Event Receiver makes an
   HTTP POST request to the Remove Subject Endpoint, containing in the
   body a JSON object with the following claims:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  The stream from which the subject is being removed.

   subject

      REQUIRED.  A Subject claim identifying the subject to be removed.

7.1.4.  Verification

   In some cases, the frequency of event transmission on an Event Stream
   will be very low, making it difficult for an Event Receiver to tell
   the difference between expected behavior and event transmission
   failure due to a misconfigured stream.  Event Receivers can request
   that a verification event be transmitted over the Event Stream,
   allowing the receiver to confirm that the stream is configured
   correctly upon successful receipt of the event.  The acknowledgment
   of a Verification Event also confirms to the Event Transmitter that
   end-to-end delivery is working, including signature verification and
   encryption.

   An Event Transmitter MAY send a Verification Event at any time, even
   if one was not requested by the Event Receiver.

7.1.4.1.  Verification Event

   The Verification Event is a standard SET with the following
   attributes:

   event type

      The Event Type URI is: "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/ssf/
      event-type/verification".

   state

      OPTIONAL An opaque value provided by the Event Receiver when the
      event is triggered.  This is a nested attribute in the event
      payload.

   Upon receiving a Verification Event, the Event Receiver SHALL parse
   the SET and validate its claims.  In particular, the Event Receiver
   SHALL confirm that the value for "state" is as expected.  If the
   value of "state" does not match, an error response of "setData"
   SHOULD be returned (see Section 2.3 of [DELIVERYPUSH] or
   [DELIVERYPOLL]).

   In many cases, Event Transmitters MAY disable or suspend an Event
   Stream that fails to successfully verify based on the acknowledgement
   or lack of acknowledgement by the Event Receiver.

7.1.4.2.  Triggering a Verification Event.

   To request that a verification event be sent over an Event Stream,
   the Event Receiver makes an HTTP POST request to the Verification
   Endpoint, with a JSON [RFC7159] object containing the parameters of
   the verification request, if any.  On a successful request, the event
   transmitter responds with an empty "204 No Content" response.

   Verification requests have the following properties:

   stream_id

      REQUIRED.  The stream that the verification event is being
      requested on.

   state

      OPTIONAL.  An arbitrary string that the Event Transmitter MUST
      echo back to the Event Receiver in the verification event's
      payload.  Event Receivers MAY use the value of this parameter to
      correlate a verification event with a verification request.  If
      the verification event is initiated by the transmitter then this
      parameter MUST not be set.

   A successful response from a POST to the Verification Endpoint does
   not indicate that the verification event was transmitted
   successfully, only that the Event Transmitter has transmitted the
   event or will do so at some point in the future.  Event Transmitters
   MAY transmit the event via an asynchronous process, and SHOULD
   publish an SLA for verification event transmission times.  Event
   Receivers MUST NOT depend on the verification event being transmitted
   synchronously or in any particular order relative to the current
   queue of events.

7.1.5.  Stream Updated Event

   A Transmitter MAY change the stream status in reference to one or
   more Subjects without a request from a Receiver.  The Transmitter
   sends an event of type "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/ssf/
   event-type/stream-updated" to indicate that it has changed the status
   of the Event Stream for a specific Subject.

   If a Transmitter decides to change the status of an Event Stream from
   "enabled" to either "paused" or "disabled", then the Transmitter MUST
   send this event to any Receiver that is currently "enabled" to
   receive events from this stream.

   If the Transmitter changes the status of the stream for a Subject
   from either "paused" or "disabled" to "enabled", then it MUST send
   this event to any Receiver that has previously been enabled to
   receive events for the specified Subject.

   The "stream-updated" event MAY contain the following claims:

8.  Authorization

   HTTP API calls from a Receiver to a Transmitter SHOULD be authorized
   by providing an OAuth 2.0 Access Token as defined by [RFC6750].

   The receiver may obtain an access token using the Client Credential
   Grant [CLIENTCRED], or any other method suitable for the Receiver and
   the Transmitter.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Subject Probing

   It may be possible for an Event Transmitter to leak information about
   subjects through their responses to add subject requests.  A "404"
   response may indicate to the Event Receiver that the subject does not
   exist, which may inadvertently reveal information about the subject
   (e.g. that a particular individual does or does not use the Event
   Transmitter's service).






Tulshibagwale, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 46]

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


   Event Transmitters SHOULD carefully evaluate the conditions under
   which they will return error responses to add subject requests.
   Event Transmitters MAY return a "204" response even if they will not
   actually send any events related to the subject, and Event Receivers
   MUST NOT assume that a 204 response means that they will receive
   events related to the subject.

9.2.  Information Harvesting

   SETs may contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other
   non-public information about the event transmitter, the subject (of
   an event in the SET), or the relationship between the two.  It is
   important for Event Transmitters to understand what information they
   are revealing to Event Receivers when transmitting events to them,
   lest the event stream become a vector for unauthorized access to
   private information.

   Event Transmitters SHOULD interpret add subject requests as
   statements of interest in a subject by an Event Receiver, and ARE NOT
   obligated to transmit events related to every subject an Event
   Receiver adds to the stream.  Event Transmitters MAY choose to
   transmit some, all, or no events related to any given subject and
   SHOULD validate that they are permitted to share the information
   contained within an event with the Event Receiver before transmitting
   the event.  The mechanisms by which such validation is performed are
   outside the scope of this specification.

9.3.  Malicious Subject Removal

   A malicious party may find it advantageous to remove a particular
   subject from a stream, in order to reduce the Event Receiver's
   ability to detect malicious activity related to the subject,
   inconvenience the subject, or for other reasons.  Consequently it may
   be in the best interests of the subject for the Event Transmitter to
   continue to send events related to the subject for some time after
   the subject has been removed from a stream.

   Event Transmitters MAY continue sending events related to a subject
   for some amount of time after that subject has been removed from the
   stream.  Event Receivers MUST tolerate receiving events for subjects
   that have been removed from the stream, and MUST NOT report these
   events as errors to the Event Transmitter.

10.  Privacy Considerations

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


10.1.  Subject Information Leakage

   Event issuers and recipients SHOULD take precautions to ensure that
   they do not leak information about subjects via Subject Identifiers,
   and choose appropriate Subject Identifier Types accordingly.  Parties
   SHOULD NOT identify a subject using a given Subject Identifier Type
   if doing so will allow the recipient to correlate different claims
   about the subject that they are not known to already have knowledge
   of.  Transmitters and Receivers SHOULD always use the same Subject
   Identifier Type and the same claim values to identify a given subject
   when communicating with a given party in order to reduce the
   possibility of information leakage.

10.2.  Previously Consented Data

   If SSF events contain new values for attributes of Subject Principals
   that were previously exchanged between the Transmitter and Receiver,
   then there are no additional privacy considerations introduced by
   providing the updated values in the SSF events, unless the attribute
   was exchanged under a one-time consent obtained from the user.

10.3.  New Data

   Data that was not previously exchanged between the Transmitter and
   the Receiver, or data whose consent to exchange has expired has the
   following considerations:

10.3.1.  Organizational Data

   If a user has previously agreed with a Transmitter that they agree to
   release certain data to third-parties, then the Transmitter MAY send
   such data in SSF events without additional consent of the user.  Such
   data MAY include organizational data about the Subject Principal that
   was generated by the Transmitter.

10.3.2.  Consentable Data

   If a Transmitter intends to include data in SSF events that is not
   previously consented to be released by the user, then the Transmitter
   MUST obtain consent to release such data from the user in accordance
   with the Transmitter's privacy policy.

11.  Profiles

   This section is a profile of the following IETF SecEvent
   specifications:

   *  Security Event Token (SET) [RFC8417]

   *  Push-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP [DELIVERYPUSH]

   *  Poll-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP [DELIVERYPOLL]

   The RISC use cases that set the requirements are described in
   Security Events RISC Use Cases [USECASES].

   The CAEP use cases that set the requirements are described in CAEP
   Use Cases (TODO: Add reference when file is added to repository.)

11.1.  Security Event Token Profile

   This section provides SSF profiling specifications for the Security
   Event Token (SET) [RFC8417] spec.

11.1.1.  Signature Key Resolution

   The signature key can be obtained through "jwks_uri", see Section 6.

11.1.2.  SSF Event Subject

   The subject of a SSF event is identified by the "subject" claim
   within the event payload, whose value is a Subject Identifier.  The
   "subject" claim is REQUIRED for all SSF events.  The JWT "sub" claim
   MUST NOT be present in any SET containing a SSF event.

11.1.3.  SSF Event Properties

   The SSF event MAY contain additional claims within the event payload
   that are specific to the event type.

     }
   }

11.1.4.  Explicit Typing of SETs

   SSF events MUST use explicit typing as defined in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC8417].

   {
     "typ":"secevent+jwt",
     "alg":"HS256"
   }

                  Figure 44: Explicitly Typed JOSE Header

   The purpose is defense against confusion with other JWTs, as
   described in Sections 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 of [RFC8417].  While current
   Id Token [IDTOKEN] validators may not be using the "typ" header
   parameter, by requiring it for SSF SETs a distinct value is
   guaranteed for future validators.

11.1.5.  The "exp" Claim

   The "exp" claim MUST NOT be used in SSF SETs.

   The purpose is defense in depth against confusion with other JWTs, as
   described in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of [RFC8417].

11.1.6.  The "aud" Claim

   The "aud" claim can be a single value or an array.  Each value SHOULD
   be the OAuth 2.0 client ID.  Other values that uniquely identifies
   the Receiver to the Transmitter MAY be used, if the two parties have
   agreement on the format.

   More than one value can be present if the corresponding Receivers are
   known to the Transmitter to be the same entity, for example a web
   client and a mobile client of the same application.  All the
   Receivers in this case MUST use the exact same delivery method.

   If multiple Receivers have the exact same delivery configuration but
   the Transmitter does not know if they belong to the same entity then
   the Transmitter SHOULD issue distinct SETs for each Receiver and
   deliver them separately.  In this case the multiple Receivers might
   use the same service to process SETs, and this service might reroute
   SETs to respective Receivers, an "aud" claim with multiple Receivers
   would lead to unintended data disclosure.

   {
     "jti": "123456",
     "iss": "https://transmitter.example.com",
     "aud": ["receiver.example.com/web", "receiver.example.com/mobile"],
     "iat": 1493856000,
     "events": {
       "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/ssf/event-type/verification": {
         "state": "VGhpcyBpcyBhbiBleGFtcGxlIHN0YXRlIHZhbHVlLgo="
       }
     }
   }

               Figure 45: Example: SET with array 'aud' claim

11.1.7.  The "events" claim

   The "events" claim SHOULD contain only one event.  Multiple event
   type URIs are permitted only if they are alternative URIs defining
   the exact same event type.

11.1.8.  Security Considerations

11.1.8.1.  Distinguishing SETs from other Kinds of JWTs

   Of particular concern is the possibility that SETs are confused for
   other kinds of JWTs.  The Security Considerations section of
   [RFC8417] has several sub-sections on this subject.  The Shared
   Signals Framework is asking for further restrictions:

   *  The "sub" claim MUST NOT be present, as described in
      Section 11.1.2.

   *  SSF SETs MUST use explicit typing, as described in Section 11.1.4.

   *  The "exp" claim MUST NOT be present, as described in
      Section 11.1.5.

11.2.  SET Token Delivery Using HTTP Profile

   This section provides SSF profiling specifications for the
   [DELIVERYPUSH] and [DELIVERYPOLL] specs.

11.2.1.  Stream Configuration Metadata

   Each delivery method is identified by a URI, specified below by the
   "method" metadata.

11.2.1.1.  Push Delivery using HTTP

   This section provides SSF profiling specifications for the
   [DELIVERYPUSH] spec.

   method

      "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/delivery-method/push"

   endpoint_url

      The URL where events are pushed through HTTP POST.  This is set by
      the Receiver.  If a Reciever is using multiple streams from a
      single Transmitter and needs to keep the SETs separated, it is
      RECOMMENDED that the URL for each stream be unique.

   authorization_header

      The HTTP Authorization header that the Transmitter MUST set with
      each event delivery, if the configuration is present.  The value
      is optional and it is set by the Receiver.

11.2.1.2.  Polling Delivery using HTTP

   This section provides SSF profiling specifications for the
   [DELIVERYPOLL] spec.

   method

      "https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/delivery-method/poll"

                              SharedSignals                February 2023


   endpoint_url

      The URL where events can be retrieved from.  This is specified by
      the Transmitter.  These URLs MAY be reused across Receivers, but
      MUST be unique per stream for a given Receiver.

12.  IANA Considerations

   Subject Identifiers defined in this document will be added to the
   "Security Events Subject Identifier Types" registry.  This registry
   is defined in the Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens
   [SUBIDS] specification.
