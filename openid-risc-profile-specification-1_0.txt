1.  Introduction

   This specification defines event types and their contents based on
   the SSE Framework [SSE-FRAMEWORK] that are required to implement Risk
   Incident Sharing and Coordination.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Event Types

   The base URI for RISC event types is:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/

2.1.  Account Credential Change Required

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/account-
   credential-change-required

   Account Credential Change Required signals that the account
   identified by the subject was required to change a credential.  For
   example the user was required to go through a password change.

   Attributes: none

   has been enabled.

   Attributes: none

2.5.  Identifier Changed

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/identifier-
   changed

   Identifier Changed signals that the identifier specified in the
   subject has changed.  The subject type MUST be either "email" or
   "phone" and it MUST specify the old value.

   This event SHOULD be issued only by the provider that is
   authoritative over the identifier.  For example, if the person that
   owns "john.doe@example.com" goes through a name change and wants the

   new "john.row@example.com" email then *only* the email provider
   "example.com" SHOULD issue an Identifier Changed event as shown in
   the example below.

   If an identifier used as a username or recovery option is changed, at
   a provider that is not authoritative over that identifier, then
   Recovery Information Changed (Section 2.10) SHOULD be used instead.

   Attributes:

   o  new-value - optional, the new value of the identifier.

         },
         "new-value": "john.roe@example.com",
       }
     }
   }

   The "foo@example.com" email changed to "bar@example.com".  _(the
   event type URI is wrapped, the backslash is the continuation
   character)_

2.6.  Identifier Recycled

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/identifier-
   recycled

   Identifier Recycled signals that the identifier specified in the
   subject was recycled and now it belongs to a new user.  The subject
   type MUST be either "email" or "phone".

   compromise"

   A Credential Compromise event signals that the identifier specified
   in the subject was found to be compromised.

   Attributes:

   o  credential_type - REQUIRED.  The type of credential that is
      compromised.  The value of this attribute must be one of the
      values specified for the similarly named field in the "Credential
      Change" event defined in the CAEP Specification
      [CAEP-SPECIFICATION].

   o  event_timestamp - OPTIONAL.  JSON number: the time at which the
      event described by this SET was discovered by the Transmitter.
      Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from
      1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

   o  reason_admin - OPTIONAL.  The reason why the credential
      compromised event was generated, intended for administrators

2.8.  Opt Out

   Users SHOULD be allowed to opt-in and out of RISC events being sent
   for their accounts.  With regards to opt-out an account can be in one
   of these three states:

   1.  opt-in - the account is participating in RISC event exchange.

   2.  opt-out-initiated - the user requested to be excluded from RISC
       event exchanges, but for practical security reasons for a period
       of time RISC events are still exchanged.  The main reason for
       this state is to prevent a hijacker from immediately opting out
       of RISC.

   3.  opt-out - the account is NOT participating in RISC event
       exchange.

                Figure 6: Opt-Out States and Opt-Out Events

   Both Transmitters and Receivers SHOULD manage Opt-Out state for
   users.  Transmitters should send the events defined in this section
   when the Opt-Out state changes.

2.8.1.  Opt In

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/opt-in

   Opt In signals that the account identified by the subject opted into
   RISC event exchanges.  The account is in the "opt-in" state.

   Attributes: none

2.8.2.  Opt Out Initiated

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/opt-out-initiated

   Opt Out Initiated signals that the account identified by the subject
   initiated to opt out from RISC event exchanges.  The account is in
   the "opt-out-initiated" state.

2.8.3.  Opt Out Cancelled

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/opt-out-cancelled

   Opt Out Cancelled signals that the account identified by the subject
   cancelled the opt out from RISC event exchanges.  The account is in
   the "opt-in" state.

   Attributes: none

2.8.4.  Opt Out Effective

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/opt-out-effective

   Opt Out Effective signals that the account identified by the subject
   was effectively opted out from RISC event exchanges.  The account is
   in the "opt-out" state.

   Attributes: none

2.9.  Recovery Activated

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/recovery-
   activated

   Recovery Activated signals that the account identified by the subject
   activated a recovery flow.

   Attributes: none

2.10.  Recovery Information Changed

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/recovery-
   information-changed

   Recovery Information Changed signals that the account identified by
   the subject has changed some of its recovery information.  For
   example a recovery email address was added or removed.

   Attributes: none

2.11.  Sessions Revoked

   Note: This event type is now deprecated.  New implementations MUST
   use the "session-revoked" event defined in the CAEP Specification
   [CAEP-SPECIFICATION].

   Event Type URI:
   https://schemas.openid.net/secevent/risc/event-type/sessions-revoked

   Sessions Revoked signals that all the sessions for the account
   identified by the subject have been revoked.

   Attributes: none

3.  Compatibility

3.1.  Google Subject Type Value

   Implementers are hereby made aware that the existing RISC
   implementation by Google uses the field name "subject_type" instead
   of the field name "format" to indicate the format of the subject
   identifier.  The usage of the field name "subject_type" is deprecated
   and new services MUST NOT use this field name.

   Relying parties wishing to receive events from the Google RISC
   transmitter therefore need to have code to work around this, until
   such time as their implementation is updated.  Any such workaround
   should be written in a manner that does not break if Google updates
   their implementation to conform to this specification.
