--- abstract
This document defines an interoperability profile for implementations of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) {{SSF}} and the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) {{CAEP}}. This also profiles The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework {{RFC6749}} usage in the context of the SSF framework. The interoperability profile is organized around use-cases that improve security of authenticated sessions. It specifies certain optional elements from within the SSF and CAEP specifications as being required to be supported in order to be considered as an interoperable implementation. 

Interoperability between SSF and CAEP, leveraging OAuth {{RFC6749}} provides greater assurance to implementers that their implementations will work out of the box with others.

# Introduction {#introduction}
SSF and CAEP together enable improved session security outcomes. This specification defines the minimum required features from SSF and CAEP that an implementation MUST offer in order to be considered as an interoperable implementation. This document defines specific use cases. An implementation MAY support only a subset of the use cases defined herein, and SHALL be considered an interoperable implementation for the specific use-cases it supports. The following use-cases are considered as a part of this specification:

Session Revocation
: A SSF Transmitter or Receiver is able to respectively generate or respond to the CAEP session-revoked event

Credential Change
: A SSF Transmitter or Receiver is able to respectively generate or respond to the CAEP credential-change event

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when,
they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Common Requirements {#common-requirements}
The following requirements are common across all use-cases defined in this document.

## Network layer protection
* The SSF transmitter MUST offer TLS protected endpoints and MUST establish connections to other servers using TLS. TLS connections MUST be set up to use TLS version 1.2 or later.
* When using TLS 1.2, follow the recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security in [RFC7525]{{RFC7525}}.
* The SSF receiver MUST perform a TLS server certificate signature checks, chain of trust validations, expiry and revocation status checks before calling the SSF transmitter APIs, as per [RFC6125]{{RFC6125}}.

## CAEP specification version
This specification supports CAEP {{CAEP}} events from Implementer's Draft 2

## Transmitters {#common-transmitters}
Transmitters MUST implement the following features:

### Spec Version {#spec-version}
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST have a `spec_version` field, and its value MUST be `1_0-ID2` or greater

### Delivery Method {#delivery-method}
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST include the `delivery_methods_supported` field.

### JWKS URI {#jwks-uri}
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST include the `jwks_uri` field, and its value MUST provide the current signing key of the Transmitter.

### Configuration Endpoint {#configuration-endpoint}
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST include the `configuration_endpoint` field. The specified endpoint MUST support the `POST` method in order to be able to create a stream.

### Status Endpoint {#status-endpoint}
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST include the `status_endpoint` field. The specified endpoint MUST support the `GET` and `POST` methods in order to get and update the stream status respectively. The Transmitter MUST support the following values in an Update Stream Status request:

* `enabled`
* `paused`
* `disabled`

For streams that are `paused`, the Transmitter MUST specify (offline) the resource constraints on how many events it can keep, or for how long. The way a Transmitter specifies this information is outside the scope of the SSF spec.

### Verification Endpoint {#verification-endpoint}
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST include the `verification_endpoint` field. The specified endpoint MUST provide a way to request verification events to be sent.

### Authorization Schemes
The Transmitter Configuration Metadata MUST include the `authorization_schemes` field and its value MUST include the value

~~~json
{
    "spec_urn": "urn:ietf:rfc:6749"
}
~~~

### Streams {#common-stream-configuration}
In all streams created by the Transmitter, the following MUST be true:

#### Delivery {#common-delivery}
A Transmitter MUST be able to accept a Create Stream request that includes either of the following delivery methods:

* urn:ietf:rfc:8935 (Push)
* urn:ietf:rfc:8936 (Poll)

The `delivery` field MUST be present in the Configuration of any Stream generated by the Transmitter, and its value MUST include one of the two delivery methods listed above.

#### Stream Control
The following Stream Configuration API Methods MUST be supported:

**Creating a Stream**
: Receivers MUST be able to create a Stream with the Transmitter using valid authorization with the Transmitter. The Transmitter MAY support multiple streams with the same Receiver

**Reading Stream Configuration**
: A Receiver MUST be able to obtain current Stream configuration from the Transmitter by providing a valid authorization

**Getting the Stream Status**
: A Receiver MUST be able to obtain the current Stream status from the Transmitter by providing a valid authorization

**Stream Verification**
: A Receiver MUST be able to verify the liveness of the Stream by requesting that the Transmitter send it a Stream Verificaiton event by providing a valid authorization

## Receivers {#common-receivers}
Receivers MUST implement the following features:

### Delivery Methods {#common-receiver-delivery}
Receivers MUST be able to accept events using the Push-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP {{RFC8935}} specification and the Poll-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP {{RFC8936}} specification.

### Implicitly Added Subjects {#common-receiver-subjects}
Receivers MUST assume that all subjects are implicitly included in a Stream, without any `AddSubject` method invocations.

## Event Subjects {#common-event-subjects}
The following subject identifier formats from "Subject Identifiers for Security Event Tokens" {{RFC9493}} MUST be supported:

* `email`
* `iss_sub`
* `opaque` (for the Verification event only)

Receivers MUST be prepared to accept events with any of the subject identifier formats specified in this section. Transmitters MUST be able to send events with at least one of subject identifier formats specified in this section.

## Event Signatures
All events MUST be signed using the `RS256` algorithm using a minimum of 2048-bit keys.

## OAuth Service

### Authorization Server
* MAY distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) via the metadata document as specified in [RFC8414]{{RFC8414}}
* MUST support at least one of the following to obtain a short-lived access token. For example, a short lived access token could be defined as one in which the value of the `exp` claim is not longer than 60 mins after `nbf` claim. Please refer to Access token lifetimes in the security considerations of {{FAPI}} for additional considerations. 
  - client credential grant flow {{RFC6749}} section 4.4
  - authorization code flow {{RFC6749}} section 4.1

### OAuth Scopes
Depending on the features supported by the OAuth service and the SSF APIs, the client SHALL discover the OAuth scopes as follows:

1. If the Resource Server, hosting SSF configuration APIs, supports OAuth Protected Resource Metadata {{OPRM}} then the client MUST obtain the required scopes by using it.

2. If the Resource Server does not support {{OPRM}}, then the following scopes MUST be supported -
   - An OAuth {{RFC6749}} authorization server that is used to issue tokens to SSF Receivers, MUST reserve the scopes for the SSF endpoints with the prefix of `ssf`
   - All the SSF stream configuration management API operations MUST accept `ssf.manage` scope
   - All the SSF stream configuration Read API operations MUST accept `ssf.read` scope
   - Authorization server MAY postfix scope names with more granular operations eg. `ssf.manage.create`, `ssf.manage.update` etc.
   - Transmitter managed poll endpoint MAY support the postfix scopes in the same nomenclature as `ssf.manage.poll`

### The SSF Transmitter as a Resource Server
* MUST accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750]{{RFC6750}}
* MUST NOT accept access tokens in the query parameters stated in Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750]{{RFC6750}}
* MUST verify the validity, integrity, expiration and revocation status of access tokens
* MUST verify that the authorization represented by the access token is sufficient for the requested resource access.
* If the access token is not sufficient for the requested action, the Resource server MUST return errors as per section 3.1 of [RFC6750]{{RFC6750}}
* MAY publish the {{OPRM}} to describe the metadata needed to interact with the protected resource.

## Security Event Token

### The "events" claim
The "events" claim of the SET MUST contain only one event.

# Use Cases
Implementations MAY choose to support one or more of the following use-cases in order to be considered interoperable implementations

## Session Revocation / Logout
In order to support session revocation or logout, implementations MUST support the CAEP event type `session-revoked`. The `reason_admin` field of the event MUST be populated with a non-empty value.

## Credential Change
In order to support notifying and responding to credential changes, implementations MUST support the CAEP event type `credential-change`.
Within the `credential-change` event, implementations MUST support the following field values:

`change_type`
: Receivers MUST interpret all allowable values of this field. Transmitters MAY generate any allowable value of this field

`credential_type`
: Receivers MUST interpret all allowable values of this field. Transmitters MAY generate any allowable value of this field

`reason_admin`
: Transmitters MUST populate this value with a non-empty string

# Security Considerations
There are no additional security considerations that arise from this document. These are covered in the "Security Considerations" sections of {{SSF}} and {{CAEP}} specifications.
